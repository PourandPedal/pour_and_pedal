      You won’t need to worry about summer traffic or refilling for gas.  The 13 to 16-mile excursion will allow you to get your daily exercise.  Our company provides top of the line comfort bicycles and all necessary equipment at no additional cost.  Our bicycles are equipped with baskets so you can safely transport any purchases during the tour.  Feel free to bring your own bicycles and equipment if you feel more comfortable.  Select dates allow us to ride through the vineyard – something you can only experience with Pour and Pedal Bike Tours!!!
